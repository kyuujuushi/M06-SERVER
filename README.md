#Ho Ho Ho!
you have decided to break your own fourth wall YEET. Lemme answer some questions for y'all cus you might think this is legit :D

##What's the purpose of this repository?
This repository is used for an arg/unfiction story that started with the twitter handle @crymoth58 which a young man from another universe ends up getting access to that twitter account that can communitcate with our world. I plan to use this repository as a server for the websites that basically came from his world M06-FA107.72-a which in short is called M06 since I won't really deal with parallel versions of M06.

##Why are you making an ARG/Unfiction story?
I am making a webcommic BLOOD BOY (which it's first chapeter isn't out yet) and want to spread the story into different mediums. Kinda keeping my workflow fresh. I might also add a fake investigating account on twitter/youtube/github marble hornets style to try to get more attention which is another reason for it. ***marketing***

##Can I contribute?
You'll need to contact my discord if you're interested because I can have up to five contributors for this repos because I'm using the free version of github. If I end up with more team members to help out than I can put on this repos, I'll make a discord server for it. My discord is alan#3569
